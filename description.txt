Beach
Sun and beach tourism refers to holidays taken for the purpose of staying in or near beaches.
The most common activity for Europeans on a beach holiday is relaxing, which means they go sunbathing,
swim, picnic and play on the beach. For many young people, beach holidays also includes partying and clubbing.

Sightseeing
If you go sightseeing or do some sightseeing, you travel around visiting the interesting places that tourists usually visit.

Diving
The main purpose of dive tourism is to take part in scuba diving activities. Dive tourism includes an increasingly wide 
range of recreational dive activities. It is considered a niche market of adventure or sports tourism.

Cruise
Cruise tourism can be defined as a luxurious form of travelling, involving an all-inclusive holiday on a cruise ship of at 
least 48 hours, with a set and specific itinerary, in which the cruise ship calls at several ports or cities.

Trekking
Trekking - or long-distance hiking - consists of walking for several days or several weeks and being entirely or partially self-sufficient.

Ski
Ski-in/ski-out means exactly as it sounds, with the slopes right outside your door. Ski directly to the lifts and ski home at the end
of the day. There are no crowded shuttle rides or long walks from the shuttle stop to your home.
